Using npm, you can create links to local packages.

When you link to a package, it can be referenced as if it were a global package.

Package linking has two steps.

Step 1
The first step is to create the link: changing to the directory of the project you want to make linkable and issue command to create the link.

The following code shows how to create a link, assuming that your module is located in foo-module.

cd foo-module
npm link
After executing the npm link command, verify that the link was created using npm ls -g.

Step 2
The second step is to reference the link.

First, change to the directory that will import the linked module. Next, issue another npm link command with the linked module's name.

Suppose, the foo-module link is referenced from a second module, bar-module.

cd bar-module
npm link foo-module
Unlinking Packages
To remove a linked module, use the npm unlink command, followed by the name.

The following code removes the linked foo-module from bar-module.

cd bar-module
npm unlink foo-module
To remove a link from your system, change to the linked module's directory, and issue the npm unlink command.

cd foo-module
npm unlink
