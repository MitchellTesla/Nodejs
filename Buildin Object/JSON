JSON, or JavaScript Object Notation is the data exchange format.

JSON is similar to object literal notation with two key differences.

In object literal notation, wrapping the property names in single or double quotation marks is optional, in JSON it is mandatory.

Example
All strings should be double-quoted in JSON as follows:


// valid object literal notation, INVALID JSON:
var obj = {
   // JSON strings are supposed to use ", not '
   "first_name": 'HTML',
   // Must wrap property names for JSON
   last_name: "CSS"
}/*from w w  w  .  java  2 s.c  om*/

// valid JSON and object literal notation:
var obj = {
   "first_name": "HTML",
   "last_name": "CSS"
}

Note
To generate JSON, we can use the V8 Javascript functions JSON.parse and JSON.stringify.

The former takes a JSON string and converts it to an object, while the latter takes an object and returns a JSON string representation of it.
