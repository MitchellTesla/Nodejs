Strings in JavaScript are sequences of Unicode characters.

We use a string of length 1 to represent character.

Strings can be wrapped in single or double quotation marks.

They are functionally equivalent.

To include a single quotation mark inside a single-quoted string, we can use \', and similarly for double quotation marks inside double-quoted strings, we can use \":


console.log('Javascript\'s new feature.')
console.log("\"Hey, new feature!\", he said.")


Example
To get the length of a string in JavaScript, just use the length property:


var x = "cat";
console.log(x.length);


To add two strings together, you can use the + operator:


var s = "CSS" + " is " + "cool";
console.log(s);


Javascript + can convert them as best it can:


var distance = 25;
var s = "This is a test: " + distance + ".";
console.log(s);
